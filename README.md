# Mosaic Robot
## Team Name: Frank Ferries

The reason why most of the starter code is not here is because a lot of it is not needed. The only I/O our project needs is the touch sensors and motors. And we push our code from the Pi (by connecting it to a mobile hotspot, due to the McGill Wifi's firewall).

To run our app, look for `main.py`. Make sure to have the system set up.
